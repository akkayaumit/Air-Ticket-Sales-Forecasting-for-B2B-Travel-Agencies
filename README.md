# Air Ticket Sales Forecasting for B2B Travel Agencies
Air Ticket Sales Forecasting for B2B Travel Agencies
Ticket sales forecasting is a significant practice used by many businesses for budget planning and revenue management. It is also crucial for travel agencies to be able to make sales forecasts for some periods. As far as we know, there is no study on conducting ticket sales forecasting for B2B travel agencies. In this study, we addressed the air ticket sales forecasting problem for B2B travel agencies and proposed a novel method combining RNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models. We collected eight years (2014â€“2022) of daily search and sales data, along with external factors such as public holidays, weather, COVID-19 cases, currency parity, and per capita income for key destinations. We constructed two datasets: Dataset 1 with all features, and Dataset 2 excluding COVID-19 data, and applied RNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, and our proposed hybrid model. Using Random Forest for feature selection, we tested various subsets. The results showed no significant difference between Dataset 1 and Dataset 2, indicating that excluding COVID-19 data did not significantly affect accuracy. However, the pandemic years still introduced some volatility, which impacted performance. The proposed hybrid method consistently achieved the lowest MAPE across both datasets, with the best performance at 5.83% for Dataset 1 and 6.51% for Dataset 2. BiLSTM was the second-best performer. These results demonstrate that combining RNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM enhances the model's ability to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies.
